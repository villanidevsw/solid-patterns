We’re going to model a home entertainment system and the ability for a user to be able to use a single 
remote control to control multiple digital devices such as a TV or sound system etc. 
Keep in mind we only want one controller in our living room! It’s a nice universal controller 
capable of connecting to multiple devices.This may call for using the singleton design pattern

1)Create a RemoteControl class with 3 methods in it. 
One for choosing the device to connect the remote control to (make this a static method), 
and the other 2 methods are for turning that particular device on or off. 
2)Create three other classes – Projector, TV, SurroundSoundSystem. 
All three of these devices should follow a consistent interface so that the same remote can be used 
to turn the devices on or off.
(Obs: Remember, you want to implement this in such a way that if more devices need to be controlled by 
the same remote in the future, that can be easily done)
3)The last class you can create is the Person class. This will be the user of the home entertainment system. 
You can define a main method in this class to test out your code. Initialize the devices here and have 
the remote connect to that device to turn it on or off.
